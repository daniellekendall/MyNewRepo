        <p>I have always loved to cook because I value my health and enjoy incorporating whole foods into my meals. Cooking allows me to take control of what I eat, ensuring that my meals are nutritious and balanced. I really enjoy finding new recipes and trying new things, whether it's experimenting with different flavors or recreating dishes from various cultures.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite resources about this hobby is <a href="https://new-york.selfup.com/blogs/nyc-magazine/how-to-get-into-cooking-as-a-hobby" target="_blank">this website</a>.</p>
